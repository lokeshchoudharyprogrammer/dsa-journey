[DSA Journey](https://app.clickup.com/9016625685/whiteboards/8cpxjgn-476)


Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** journey! This repository is dedicated to my learning process as I explore essential DSA concepts, algorithms, data structures, problem-solving techniques, and resources. It serves as a personal guide to help solidify my understanding and improve my problem-solving skills in programming.

## What's Inside:

### 1. **Algorithms**
   - A collection of key algorithms with clear explanations and code examples. This section covers common algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph traversal, among others, which form the foundation of DSA.

### 2. **Data Structures**
   - Practical code examples for essential data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Understanding these structures is critical for solving complex problems efficiently.

### 3. **Problem Solutions**
   - Solutions to common programming challenges, helping to apply DSA concepts in real-world scenarios. These exercises will enhance my problem-solving abilities and prepare me for coding interviews.

### 4. **Educational Resources**
   - Curated resources including books, online courses, and coding platforms to assist in my DSA learning journey. These materials are chosen to strengthen my understanding and offer additional practice.

This repository is a reflection of my journey as I dive deeper into DSA, tackle complex problems, and gradually build up my programming skills. Whether you're starting your own DSA journey or looking for a reference, feel free to explore, contribute, or use this as a guide to further your own learning.

Let's grow together and sharpen our skills in Data Structures and Algorithms!
